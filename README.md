Gave_it_a_shot
--------------------------
    all for the best
pleasures for 	important	 the best
on a broadcast station that
	 won't be written about in
nostaglic forums, never bought up
but that reboot would have been
  pretty awesome 


Girl_Whisperer
--------------------------
Love on the third look 
better than the fourth 
which is a hometown divider 
If it doesn't happen by the third
then fingers       crossed for the   fifth
       if only you looked at the wrong 		



Wildabeast
--------------------------
Kept to ourselves when it didn't matter
and paid for her own words, hanging by shroom limelight
put that shit        back
Think this is a fucking joke?
laughing all the way home with cups that
      soaked through
her eyes like this        if only



WildabeastII
--------------------------
          Wept to the sound of vomtting in the car
you have to pull your head back slightly, straighten out your bull stomach

 Throw the bag in the street because you missed the trashcan
She'll never let me forget it

 but I did 
          brine liquid that could eat up ships
In her eyes, she'll scold me for sushing her in 
in kung fu panda 3
Never the way I want to throw up again


Rose
--------------------------
charming 	toothsome	    with     
       middle name


a          lways call      me with an iphone
pushed against a grill that never      holds 
the light just right

           you better get that iphone
   my words won't sound good otherwise


Build_IT
--------------------------
determined to blow it out of proportion, I cheated, I didn't cheat enough    
  middle vowel between tongues and legs of obstructions 
Never bold enough, the font, to catch a new infection
sick within hours of the excedrin and for three days after

 I wrecked a toilet and felt bad enough to clean it before the orderlies did

 That virus that people can smell on you, blue river between
killing and killed. Only letters seperate us from the dead


Best_Bundle2
--------------------------
      he  r tons of bullet mashed clothing 
  ripp    ing the taste out of her mouth 
Metal the last copper test
she   dies within h   ours

 and left her bones for the res t of us

THE_HUNK_AND_I

*********************


The_Romantics
--------------------------
Waste space touching old posters and flinging records off the cliff
The sound is crisp, a low low billow that brightens the corners   aces to places
The shards are black obsidion
I burried the record out behind the tree I cut down for her
First love is never enough love
it lasts too               long
burning and pacing the hand you've never drawn

You know something honey? It won't end well
for me, and it won't mean well for you



VirtualGettinIt
--------------------------
 I gave her one, they gave him two

two one, her gives they what they gave  


Virtious_Game_Changer
--------------------------
More More More

phine and ring with your arms up in the air
always care, and always like the status
you don't know what they will say about you next



Too_Much_Time_With_Chronos
--------------------------
 as flustered I'm persisted
 carried This of sun, conquest. head. and no the must
whole the world to see. Poor the pay! This is the bissmark



Follow_with_care
--------------------------
Crafter with loose ships and sinking lips
Cant you see we are working?

 hard on the tip of the dick
Two modes, Horny and Hungry
First kiss doesn't have anything
on curb side blow jobs
Miracle on the eight mile
never letting her drive again


*********************
WITHOUT_THE_ZEPPELIN


Before_The_Met_Me
--------------------------



Done_With_Nothing
--------------------------
The sales socket fills with broken Cook
 She'd 	collect	 her own towel
 never mind the one she bought but the one she stole
 crafty like widdowmakers, each sole another life down the drain
 She runs to 	flash	 the last call during
 window shopping for things she could return, could get back and take
 all at the same Perch
 
 
 
 
 
 



Magic_Sentences
--------------------------
God is only as mmighty as the weakest link
I do you though, just so you know, if that makes it easier
The cusp of cliche that speaks smaller volumes than  you think
I do you though, just so you know, if that makes it easier
